# Overheating-Minigun-Effect
## **Overview**
Using your ardinuo you will have a light fade in when it detects spinning.

This project is originally for a cosplay of mine but since all my tools arent in Regina I cant make the full minigun. With that in mind however I have made a draft of the final product so you can get an idea of what I am making.

Right off the bat I realized an error. I thought and accelerometer would work for what I had planned but it turns out I need to use a Gyroscope so I'm gonna try and do the project without one. I will in the future try and get my hands on a gyroscope and do it properly but for now we get the jank accelerometer version.
